# Supervised Learning
This program learns a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) in Chomsky normal form from training data, and then tests the accuracy on test data.
The training data is a synthetic labelled corpus of sentences, with tags indicating a parse in an unknown context free grammar.
This works in tandem with the CYK-Parse and takes the input, generates a set of grammars and then tests the output generated by CYK against labelled corpus.

1. This program is written using python3.5
2. The main file is the `supervised.py` file. Inorder to run this project properly, the input corpus must be placed inside the `sentences.txt` file located within the `input` folder.
3. To run, simply run the script with the required and optional arguments `n` and `-v`.
4. The first required argument is the number of input sentences that the program should use for both the training and test data. The optional -v argument provides verbose ouput.
5. To run, simply type `$ python3.5 supervised.py {n} -v`. If the output is to be silenced simply omit the optional second argument `v`. 
6. E.g run: `$ python3.5 supervised.py 10 -v`

#NOTE: There has to be at least 2*`n` number of input corpuses.
